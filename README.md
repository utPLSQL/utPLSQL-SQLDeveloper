# utPLSQL for SQL Developer

## Introduction

utPLSQL for SQL Developer extends Oracle's SQL Developer to 

* run utPLSQL unit tests
* debug utPLSQL unit tests
* run utPLSQL code coverage reports 
* generate utPLSQL unit tests (skeletons)
* provide utPLSQL annotations and expectations as snippets

### Run utPLSQL test

In the Connections window, select a connection or one or more packages or package procedures to run utPLSQL tests. Or you can run utPLSQL tests directly from the PL/SQL editor. The test procedures are determined according to the cursor position in the PL/SQL editor.

### Debug utPLSQL test

Select the tests to debug, the same way you would if you were just running them, but select `Debug utPLSQL test...` in the context menu. 

And then the PL/SQL Debugger is called for the generated, anonymous PL/SQL block.

The initialization timeout for the realtime reporter is increased to 1 hour. The overall timeout is left to the default value of 4 hours. So you have enough time to step through the PL/SQL code and analyse it. Press the `Stop` button at any time to cancel the test run.

### Code coverage...

In the Connections window, select a connection or one or more packages for a code coverage report.

In the dialog you can set some parameters. If you run code coverage for a few chosen packages or from the PL/SQL editor the objects to be included are determined according the object dependencies in the Oracle data dictionary.

Press `Run` to produce the code coverage process in the background. You may minimize or close the dialog. To abort the process, press `Cancel`. 

The HTML report is shown in your default browser.

### Generate utPLSQL test

#### Based on existing code

Select a package, type, function or procedure to build a utPLSQL test package skeleton. The generated package compiles and executes, but still needs some rework.

#### From scratch

1. Press the button `Create code templates` in the preferences
2. Type `ut_` in the Worksheet or a PL/SQL editor and press `Ctrl-Space` to get the list of a utPLSQL code templates
3. Press `Return` to paste a code template at the current cursor position

### Snippets

Import utPLSQL snippets for annotations and expectations via the the `Import Snippets` button of the utPLSQL [preferences dialog](#preferences).

Insert the snippets by drag & drop into your code.

#### Annotations

Annotations are used in the package specification for various test configurations.

#### Expectations

Expectations are used in the package body to compare actual with expected results.

### oddgen integration

utPLSQL for SQL Developer implements the [OddgenGenerator2 interface](https://www.oddgen.org/java-interface/) to

* run existing utPLSQL test suitepaths and test suites
* bulk generate new utPLSQL unit tests into dedicated files

The use of [oddgen for SQL Developer](https://www.oddgen.org/) is optional. 

#### Run utPLSQL test

utPLSQL can run tests based on suitepaths and suites. The next screenshot shows the generated run command for two selected suitepaths.

#### Generate utPLSQL test

Use oddgen to generate utPLSQL test package skeletons. When generating to files, a file for each package specification and package body is created.

## How to Build
## How to Build

1. [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html) and install SQL Developer 21.4.3
2. [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install Apache Maven 3.8.6
3. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install a git command line client
4. Clone the utPLSQL-SQLDeveloper repository
5. Open a terminal window in the utPLSQL-SQLDeveloper root folder and type

		cd sqldev

6. Run maven build by the following command

		mvn -Dsqldev.basedir=/Applications/SQLDeveloper21.4.3.app/Contents/Resources/sqldeveloper -DskipTests=true clean package

	Amend the parameter sqldev.basedir to match the path of your SQL Developer installation. This folder is used to reference Oracle jar files which are not available in public Maven repositories
7. The resulting file ```utplsql_for_SQLDev_x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.zip``` in the ```target``` directory can be installed within SQL Developer
